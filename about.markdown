I am a first year PhD student at the [Mobile Robotics
Lab](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~mrl) at McGill University and [Mila](https://www.mila.quebec) in Montreal, Canada. I am
fortunately supervised by [David Meger](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~dmeger) and [Marc G.
Bellemare](http://www.marcgbellemare.info/).

My research interests are primarily concerned with reinforcement learning, and
particularly with methods of modeling uncertainty to improve safety and
exploration. I am a [distributional reinforcement learning](https://www.distributional-rl.org) enthusiast.
During my Master's, I derived a characterization of the distribution of returns
induced by agents whose dynamics are driven by continuous-time Markov processes,
which we used to analyze continuous time distributional RL algorithms. My thesis can be seen [here](/assets/thesis-msc.pdf).

Previously, I was a Computer Engineering undergrad at McGill, and my studies
were focused on signal processing, control, machine learning, and software
engineering. My undergraduate capstone project was supervised by [Shane
McIntosh](https://shanemcintosh.org). I got my [Iron
Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Ring) in November 2018, and was awarded
a British Association Medal. I spent two summers as an intern at Amazon, where I
designed an optimization framework for retrieving credit card properties without
revealing sensitive information for Amazon Wallet, and I designed a system to
automatically detect and localize anomalous behavior in server fleets and APIs
for [AWS Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/).

I'm also a proud enthusiast of the brilliant [Gentoo (GNU/)Linux](https://www.gentoo.org) operating
system, and I maintain some overlays on [my github page](https://github.com/harwiltz) and [my other github
page](https://github.com/DestructiveReasoning). Notably, I recently made a working [AMD
ROCm](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/) build, which allows owners of AMD GPUs (using the open
source `AMDGPU` drivers!) dating back to the Ellesmere generation to use their GPU for
high-performance scientific computing, particularly with PyTorch and Tensorflow.
