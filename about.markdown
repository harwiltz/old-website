I am a first year M.Sc. student at the [Mobile Robotics
Lab](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~mrl) at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. I am
fortunately supervised by [David Meger](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~dmeger). My
research interests are primarily concerned with reinforcement learning, and
particularly with methods of modeling uncertainty in reinforcement learning
methods to improve safety and exploration.

Previously, I was a Computer Engineering undergrad at McGill, and my studies
were focused on signal processing, control, machine learning, and software
engineering. My undergraduate capstone project was supervised by [Shane
McIntosh](https://shanemcintosh.org). I got my [Iron
Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Ring) in November 2018, and was awarded
a British Association Medal. I spent two summers as an intern at Amazon, where I
designed an optimization framework for retrieving credit card properties without
revealing sensitive information for Amazon Wallet, and I designed a system to
automatically detect and localize anomalous behavior in server fleets and APIs
for [AWS Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/).
